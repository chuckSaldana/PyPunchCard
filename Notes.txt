PunchCard Grapher displays activity as a circle radius and plots the circles according to day and hour of day.
-This could be used to display punch in/out activity

1 hour of work = activity
overlap bubble graph by showing overlap of daily activity for each week 

Use punch card py as front end graphing summary with back end
One graph would be very powerful and have a list beneath it or possibly annotation to tell you average daily hours worked

Possibly have week selection to show a graph of only that week

Possibly remake graphing back end at a low level pixel per pixel basis although I don't know how to port over the fonts, Possibly cairo?
Possibly grab a look back at punchcard py repository created on github at https://github.com/fogleman/Punchcard.git
